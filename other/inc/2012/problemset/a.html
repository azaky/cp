<h3>ACM-ICPC Indonesia National Contest 2012</h3>
<h2>Problem A</h2>
<h1>The Greatest Man in The Universe</h1>
Time Limit: 2s
</center>
<br>

<p>Given two integers A and B, and a sequence of positive integers S<sub>0..N-1</sub> which consists of N elements, determine the length of the longest subsequence which should be chosen by the following rule:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose i from 0 to N-1.</li>
<li>If S<sub>i</sub> is between A and B (inclusive), then:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Take S<sub>i</sub> to be part of the chosen subsequence.</li>
	<li>Update i with i + S<sub>i</sub>.</li>
	</ul>
	Otherwise, stop.
<li>Repeat step 2 until i &#8805; N or S<sub>i</sub> is not in between A and B.</li>
</ol>
<p>The length of a subsequence is defined as the number of elements in it.</p>

<p><small>*) In case you don't know what "inclusive" means, we say an integer P is between A and B inclusively is A &#8804; P &#8804; B is satisfied.</small></p>

<br>
<p>For example, let S contains 9 elements: {1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 7, 1, 2, 3}, A = 1 and B = 4. There are 9 possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>start with i = 0 : <b><u>1</u></b>, <u>4</u>, 2, 3, 2, <strike>7</strike>, 1, 2, 3; resulting a subsequence {1, 4} with size of 2.</li>
<li>start with i = 1 : 1, <b><u>4</u></b>, 2, 3, 2, <strike>7</strike>, 1, 2, 3; resulting a subsequence {4} with size of 1. The second element is 7 which is not between A and B, so we stop at 4.</li>
<li>start with i = 2 : 1, 4, <b><u>2</u></b>, 3, <u>2</u>, 7, <u>1</u>, <u>2</u>, 3; resulting a subsequence {2, 2, 1, 2} with size of 4.</li>
<li>start with i = 3 : 1, 4, 2, <b><u>3</u></b>, 2, 7, <u>1</u>, <u>2</u>, 3; resulting a subsequence {3, 1, 2} with size of 3.</li>
<li>start with i = 4 : 1, 4, 2, 3, <b><u>2</u></b>, 7, <u>1</u>, <u>2</u>, 3; resulting a subsequence {2, 1, 2} with size of 3.</li>
<li>start with i = 5 : 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, <b><strike>7</strike></b>, 1, 2, 3; resulting a subsequence { } with size of 0. The integer 7 cannot be used because it is not between A and B, so we stop there and the result is a subsequence with size of 0.</li>
<li>start with i = 6 : 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 7, <b><u>1</u></b>, <u>2</u>, 3; resulting a subsequence {1, 2} with size of 2.</li>
<li>start with i = 7 : 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 7, 1, <b><u>2</u></b>, 3; resulting a subsequence {2} with size of 1.</li>
<li>start with i = 8 : 1, 4, 2, 3, 2, 7, 1, 2, <b><u>3</u></b>; resulting a subsequence {3} with size of 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Out of those 9 possibilities, the longest one is {2, 2, 1, 2} which has size of 4.</p>

<p>Given S, A and B, your task is to determine the length of the longest subsequence following the above rule. The title? oh sorry, it has nothing to do with this problem.</p>




<br>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#8804; T &#8804; 100) the number of cases. Each case begins with three integers N (1 &#8804; N &#8804; 100), A and B (1 &#8804; A &#8804; B &#8804; 100) denoting the size of sequence S, A and B which described at the problem statement respectively. The next line contains N integers ranged between 1 and 100 (inclusive) denoting the sequence S.


</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output in a line the "Case #X: Y" where X is the case number starts from 1, and Y is the length of the longest subsequence that can be chosen by following the rule.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 1<sup>st</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>This is the example from problem statement.</p>
<p><i>Explanation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>The longest subsequence starts with i = 1: {2, 1, 2} with size 3.</p>
<p><i>Explanation for the 3<sup>rd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>There's no number in S which is in betweeen 8 and 10, so we can only find empty subsequence.</p>
