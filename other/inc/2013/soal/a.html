<h3>ACM-ICPC Indonesia National Contest 2013</h3>
<h2>Problem A</h2>
<h1>Word Words Wordsz</h1>
Time Limit: 2 seconds
</center>
<br>

<p>Windarik, an infamous 008 agent, got a mission to retrieve a 
world-domination instrument in a top secret government facility. In 
order to get the passkey number to the place where the instrument is 
hidden, Windarik had Bowo, another agent, to send him the passkey 
through a letter. </p>
<p>When the letter arrived, Windarik was surprised because the letter is
 full of words instead of numbers. Windarik called Bowo to clarify the 
letter, only to get snapped by Bowo "Idiot! Use your head!". Windarik 
then realized his stupidity, why would any agent sent a passkey without 
first encrypting it?</p> 
<p>After careful analysis, Windarik discovered that the key to the 
encryption is located at the last line of the letter which consists of 
three words: "word words wordsz". These three out of nowhere words seems
 to be the hint to crack the encrypted message. It did not take a lot of
 time for Windarik to arrive at a conclusion: he should count how many 
words in the letter which length is 4, 5 and 6 (associated with "word", 
"words" and "wordsz" respectively).</p>
<p>The letter is quite long and Windarik is known to be an extremely 
lazy agent. He commanded you, as an unpaid intern, to do this simple 
task. Of course he entirely believes that you would not leak this secret
 information to other agents... would you?</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#8804; T &#8804; 100) the 
number of cases. Each case begins with an integer N (1 &#8804; N &#8804; 100) 
denoting the number of words in the letter. The next N lines each 
contains a word in lowercase alphabet (a-z) which length is between 1 
and 20. The given words might not be unique, but you should treat each 
of them as different entities (see 1<sup>st</sup> sample input for clarity).</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, output in a line the "<font face="Courier New">Case #X: A B C</font>" where <font face="Courier New">X</font> is the case number starts from 1, and
</p><ul>
<li><font face="Courier New">A</font> is the number of words which length is exactly 4.</li>
<li><font face="Courier New">B</font> is the number of words which length is exactly 5.</li>
<li><font face="Courier New">C</font> is the number of words which length is exactly 6.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Explanation for the 1<sup>st</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>There are 8 words with length of 4: very, very, girl, like.</li>
<li>There are 2 words with length of 5: today, happy.</li>
<li>There is no word with length of 6</li>
</ul>
Notice there are two occurrence of "very" in the set of words with length of 4. You should count both of them.
