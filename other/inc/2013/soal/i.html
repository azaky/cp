<h3>ACM-ICPC Indonesia National Contest 2013</h3>
<h2>Problem I</h2>
<h1>Power Crisis</h1>
Time Limit: 2 seconds
</center>
<br>

<p>Jakarta is the largest city in Indonesia which deals with a large 
power consumption. It often suffers from blackout as PLN (the state 
electricity company) has difficulty in maintaining a stable electricity 
power for the city. It was so bad such that a breakdown in one of PLN's 
electric substation is enough to force a single area to lit up candles 
for one long night. In order to overcome this problem, PLN comes up with
 a plan to build yet the largest power plant in Indonesia. The power 
plant will be located at the east coast of Java and provide sufficient 
electricity power to Jakarta through series of cables.</p>

<p>There are N stations numbered from 1 to N. Station 1 is set as the 
power plant and station N as Jakarta. These stations are connected with 
cables that transmit electricity power from one station to another. Each
 cable transmits power in one specific direction (e.g. electricity power
 only travels in cable C from station A to station B and not the other 
way around). As each cable is made of an expensive special material, it 
consists of two important properties that have to be considered: a 
capacity of C<sub>i</sub> and a minimum required power of L<sub>i</sub>. These two properties define that a cable i has to transmit at least L<sub>i</sub> power and is not able to transmit more than C<sub>i</sub> power. A failure in transmitting power less than L<sub>i</sub> will result in a fast deterioration of cable i. </p>

<p>While the power plant is able to generate any amount of electricity 
power and Jakarta is able to receive any amount of electricity power 
happily, PLN requires an equilibrium constraint to be applied to all 
stations (excepts for the power plant and Jakarta). Equilibrium 
constraint defines that the total amount of incoming power should be 
equal to the total amount of outgoing power from the station. So take 
note that there are 2 types of constraints that they have to maintain:
</p><ol>
<li>equilibrium constraint for all stations (excepts for the power plant and Jakarta)</li>
<li>the electricity power which is transmitted on each cable is between L<sub>i</sub> and C<sub>i</sub>, inclusive.</li>
</ol>
It is also possible for any station to transmit power not from the power
 plant as long as it still maintains its equilibrium constraint (see 5<sup>th</sup> sample input for clarity).<p></p>

<p>The blueprint of the plan is prepared and money is not a problem. 
However, they are still not sure whether the plan is feasible. They 
wonder whether it is possible to transmit all these power from the power
 plant to Jakarta such that all cables satisfy their L<sub>i</sub> power
 requirement while maintaining the equilibrium constraint for all 
stations (except for the power plant and Jakarta). Can you help them?</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#8804; T &#8804; 100) the 
number of cases. Each case begins with two integers N and M (2 &#8804; N &#8804; 50)
 denoting the number of stations and cables respectively. All stations 
are numbered from 1 to N with station 1 as power plant and station N as 
Jakarta. The following M lines each contains four integers A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub>, L<sub>i</sub> and C<sub>i</sub> (1 &#8804; A<sub>i</sub>, B<sub>i</sub> &#8804; N; A<sub>i</sub> &#8800; N; B<sub>i</sub> &#8800; 1; A<sub>i</sub> &#8800; B<sub>i</sub>; 0 &#8804; L<sub>i</sub> &#8804; C<sub>i</sub> &#8804; 100) representing a cable which able to transmit electricity power from station A<sub>i</sub> to station B<sub>i</sub> with minimum required power L<sub>i</sub> and the maximum capacity C<sub>i</sub>. You may assume that there is at most one cable which able to transmit electricity power from station A<sub>i</sub> to station B<sub>i</sub> for all pair of A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>i</sub>.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, output in a line "<font face="Courier New">Case #X: Y</font>" where <font face="Courier New">X</font> is the case number starts from 1 and  <font face="Courier New">Y</font> is either " <font face="Courier New">YES</font>" or " <font face="Courier New">NO</font>" (without quotes) denoting whether the plan is feasible or not.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 1<sup>st</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>S1 (station 1) can transmit either 4 or 5 electricity power to S2, and S2 further transfer it to S3.</p><p><br>
</p><p><i>Explanation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>S1 can transmit at most 3 electricity power to S2. However, S2 needs 
to transfer at least 4 power to S3. Therefore, this plan is not 
feasible.</p><p><br>
</p><p><i>Explanation for the 3<sup>rd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>Here is a possible electricity power transmission:
</p><ul>
<li>S1 to S2: 7</li>
<li>S1 to S3: 2</li>
<li>S2 to S3: 5</li>
<li>S2 to S4: 2</li>
<li>S3 to S4: 7</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
</p><p><i>Explanation for the 4<sup>th</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>S1 can transmit at most 10 electricity power to S2 and S2 will divide
 the electricity power to S3 (3 electricity power) and S4 (7 electricity
 power) to fulfill the minimum power requirement. Meanwhile S1 can 
transmit at most 4 electricity power to S3 and remember that S3 already 
received 3 electricity power from S2. However, S3 needs to transmit a 
minimal of 8 electricity power to S4, but it has only a total of 7 
incoming electricity power (4 from S1 and 3 from S2). Thus, the plan is 
not feasible.</p><p><br>
</p><p><i>Explanation for the 5<sup>th</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>There are 5 stations, 5 cables and each cable has minimum required power and maximum capacity L<sub>i</sub>..C<sub>i</sub> (e.g., 2..10 means L<sub>i</sub>=2 and C<sub>i</sub>=10)
 as shown in Figure 1. The red arrow (2-3-4-2) corresponds to the 
transmitted electricity power of 2. As you might have noticed, these 
power do not come from the power plant (station 1); however, the 
equilibrium constraint is maintained and all cables satisfy their 
minimum required power and maximum capacity. Therefore, the power 
transmission in Figure 1 is a valid one.</p>
