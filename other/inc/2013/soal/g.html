<h3>ACM-ICPC Indonesia National Contest 2013</h3>
<h2>Problem G</h2>
<h1>Beautiful Gift</h1>
Time Limit: 2 seconds
</center>
<br>

<p>This Saturday, Windarik is going to meet a girl that he has known 
from a new MMORPG that he has been playing lately. Windarik is very 
happy and plan to bring a gift when he meet her from the first time in 
the real life. In order to impress her, Windarik thought of crafting a 
hand-made necklace as a present. After spending a whole afternoon, 
Windarik managed to finish a beautiful necklace. This necklace consists 
of many beads and each bead has an alphabet printed on it. Before 
putting the necklace in a box full of love pattern, Windarik made a 
thorough examination on its quality. While examining the necklace, 
Windarik asked a question to himself:</p>
<p>"If I remove K type of beads from this necklace, what would the 
longest remaining chain be?" Two beads are stated to be a different type
 if and only if the alphabet embedded on those beads are not the same.</p>
<p>Windarik did not decide which type of bead he wanted to remove, 
instead, he wants to remove the beads such that the longest remaining 
chain is as long as possible.</p>

<p>For example, let the necklace beads be: "AABACBBACBCA" as shown in 
Figure 1 (a) below. Note that the necklace is circular, so the end is 
connected to the beginning of the given string. If Windarik decides to 
remove (K =) 1 type of beads, since the necklace consists of 3 types of 
bead (A, B and C), then there are 3 possible combinations:
</p><ul>
<li>Remove all beads of type A, the longest remaining chain would be "CBB" or "CBC" which have the length of 3. See Figure 1 (b).</li>
<li>Remove all beads of type B, the longest remaining chain would be "CAAA" which has the length of 4. See Figure 1 (c).</li>
<li>Remove all beads of type C, the longest remaining chain would be "AAABA" which has the length of 5. See Figure 1 (d).</li>
</ul>
In this example, it seems that the length of the longest remaining chain
 would be 5, and we can achieve it by removing all beads of type C.

<p>Given a string S which corresponds to the beads arrangement of the 
necklace and an integer K, determine the longest remaining chain after 
we remove K type of beads from the necklace.</p>

<br>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer T (1 &#8804; T &#8804; 100) the 
number of cases. Each case begins with an integer K and a string S (0 &#8804; K
 &#8804; &#960;(S); 1 &#8804; |S| &#8804; 20,000; S<sub>i</sub> &#8712; {A-Z} &#8704;i=1..|S|) where &#960;(S) is the number of distinct character in S.</p>


<p></p>

<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each case, output in a line the "<font face="Courier New">Case #X: Y</font>" where <font face="Courier New">X</font> is the case number starts from 1, and <font face="Courier New">Y</font> is the length of the longest remaining chain after we remove K type of beads.</p>

<p><i>Explanation for the 2<sup>nd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>Remove all beads of type B and C, and we get the longest possible remaining chain "AAA" of length 3.</p><p>
</p><p><i>Explanation for the 3<sup>rd</sup> sample input.</i></p>
<p>K is equal to &#960;(S), so the necklace is completely gone.</p><p>
