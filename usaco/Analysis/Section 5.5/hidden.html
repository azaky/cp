<p>
First, we concatenate two copies of our string S, yielding SS. This
way, instead of dealing with cyclic shifts, we simply want the
lexicographically least L-letter substring of SS. But as the remaining
letters of SS after an L-letter substring are just the same as those
at the start of the substring, we might as well search for the
lexicographically least suffix of SS. If we append a terminating
character which is lexicographically after z, we will always choose
the first appropriate substring in SS.

</p><p>
How do we efficiently find the lexicographically least suffix of
SS?

</p><p>
For each i, let V[i] be the length of the longest substring starting
at i which is the lexicographically least substring in SS of that
length. For example, in "abcabab", the lexicographically least
2-letter substring is "ab", the least 3-letter substring is "aba",
so V[0]=2, as the suffix starting at 0 goes "abc...".

</p><p>
We initialize V to 0, and make a list of all possible starting
points.  We go through the list, and for each starting point i in
our list, we consider V[i+V[i]]. If V[i+V[i]] &gt; 0, then as the
V[i+V[i]]-letter substring starting as position i+V[i] is minimal,
and as the V[i]-letter substring starting at i is minimal, the
(V[i]+V[i+V[i]])-letter substring starting at i is minimal. (We're
joining our current substring to a previously computed substring.)

</p><p>
If V[j+V[j]] &gt; V[i+V[i]] for some j in our list, then the suffix
starting at j is less than the suffix starting at i, as they agree
on the first V[i]=V[j] letters (V[x] is the same for all x in our
list), and j has more minimal letters afterwards then i does
(V[j+V[j]] &gt; V[i+V[i]]). Thus, for all i in our list such that
V[i+V[i]] is maximal, we set V[i]=V[i]+V[i+V[i]].

</p><p>
We also set a flag for i+V[i] so that if it's also in our list, we
don't process it ever again, as the prefix starting at i is better.
This prevents the strings in our list from overlapping. (As we're
not processing i+V[i] anymore, we may later have a wrong value for
V[i+V[i]], but this doesn't matter as we'll never be using it again,
as the string at i+V[i] is inside of the new one at i.) We remove
all i for which V[i+V[i]] is not maximal from our list. If, on the
other hand, V[i+V[i]] = 0 for all i in our list, then we simply add
1 to V[i] for all i for which S[i+V[i]] is minimal over all i in
our list, and we remove other i from our list.

</p><p>
We repeat this process until our list has only 1 position in it,
which will be our answer.

</p><p>
What is the runtime of our algorithm? Well, at each iteration, for
each i in our list, we either merge two substrings, removing an i
from our list, or we extend a substring by 1 or more letters. Both
of these are constant time operations. Because we use previous V
values when extending substrings, we can walk over a given letter
at most once. We can also remove an i from our list only once. As
we have 2L items in our list, and 2L letters, our algorithm is O(L).
