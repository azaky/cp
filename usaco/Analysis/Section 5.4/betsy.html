<p> The state size of this problem is too large for dynamic programming,
so we must use a method like recursive descent to enumerate all paths from
corner to corner.

</p><p> To start, we will consider a "stupid" solution that generates all
paths.  When a path gets to the market, it checks to see whether it has
touched every square.

</p><p> Testing the solution, we see that it runs in time only for N &lt;= 5. So,
some optimizations are needed. Here are some:

</p><ul>
<li>
If we keep a running total of the number of squares touched by the current
path, we can check in O(1) time whether a path has touched every square when
it reaches the market.
</li><li>
If we use an array with a sentinel-buffer around the edges, we can avoid extra
complexity introduced by further optimizations. Some speed is gained, too.
</li><li>
If we keep a running sum of the total number of squares touched in each column
and in each row, we can check whether we have created a "wall" between the
market and our current position, and prune these states.
</li><li>
If we ever reach the right-hand wall at a distance vertically of Y without
having touched the square at Y-1, we know we have created a wall in some shape
that separates our current position with the square at Y-1. The same holds for
every wall.
</li></ul>

<p> These speed increases are good, but the program is still far too slow
for N = 7. What else can we prune? With a little visualization, it is easy
to see that the program generates many "dead ends," squares that once
entered, lead to the end of the path.  Because our path must eventually
touch them and will terminate when it does, a lot of searching could be
saved by pruning off states that create dead ends.

</p><p> To do this efficiently, we keep track of the number of neighbor-squares
that have been touched at each square. Each time we touch a square, we
increment its neighbors' neighbor-sum. When a sum reaches 3, we know that
we can stop because there is now a dead end at that square (unless we are
going to that square next.)

</p><p> This gives us a huge speed gain, enough to do N = 7 in about half a
second.
