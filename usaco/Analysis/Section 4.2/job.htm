<p>You can greedily determine the earliest time the kth job can be
finished by an "A" machine.  For each machine, keep track when it will
complete its current job.  The time for it to complete the next job is
this time plus the time is takes the machine to process a job.  To
determine the time for the kth job, pick the machine which would finish
it first and assign that job to it, updating the time that the machine
will complete its job.

</p><p>Similarly, determine how early the kth job from the end can be put
into a B machine, where earliness is measured from the end of all jobs.
This is akin to flipping the process around, where each finish job must
be `undone' by a B machine.

</p><p>Once these two calculations have been done and the arrays have been
sorted, you end up with a picture like this:  </p><center><img src="job_files/prob49.gif"></center><br> Each line represents the
activity of one job.  Green and blue are "A" machines, and yellow, cyan,
and purple are type "B" machines.  A red line means that the job is in
a container instead of a machine.  The left portion corresponds to "A"
jobs, where the end of each line is the time at which the kth job is
completed.  The right portion corresponds to "B" jobs, where the
beginning of the line is the earliest that the kth job can be started
with respect to the ending time of the all the "B" jobs.  The white
space in the middle represents the `slack' time, the time that the job
sits in an intermediate container.

<p>The best option is to match up the earliest completed "A" job with
the "B" job that starts earliest, the second earliest completed "A" job
with the second earliest started "B" job, etc.  Take the maximum of
these times.  This corresponds to moving the the two representations
together until they touch (one job has no 'slack' time).
