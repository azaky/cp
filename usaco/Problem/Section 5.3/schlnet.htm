<b>IOI '96 Day 1 Problem 3</b>
</center>

<p>A number of schools are connected to a computer network. Agreements 
have
been developed among those schools: each school maintains a list of 
schools
to which it distributes software (the "receiving schools"). Note that if
B is in the distribution list of school A, then A does not necessarily
appear in the list of school B.

</p><p>You are to write a program that computes the minimal number of 
schools
that must receive a copy of the new software in order for the software 
to
reach all schools in the network according to the agreement (Subtask A).
As a further task, we want to ensure that by sending the copy of new
software to an arbitrary school, this software will reach all schools in
the network. To achieve this goal we may have to extend the lists of
receivers by new members. Compute the minimal number of extensions that
have to be made so that whatever school we send the new software to, it
will reach all other schools (Subtask B). One extension means 
introducing
one new member into the list of receivers of one school.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: schlnet</h3>


<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

The first line of the input file contains an integer N: the number of
schools in the network (2&lt;=N&lt;=100). The schools are identified
by the first N positive integers. Each of the next N lines describes
a list of receivers. The line i+1 contains the identifiers of the
receivers of school i. Each list ends with a 0. An empty list contains
a 0 alone in the line.<p>

1 0
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>Your program should write two lines to the output file.  The first 
line
should contain one positive integer: the solution of subtask A. The 
second
line should contain the solution of subtask B. </p><p>
