<p> You've just be assigned the project of implemented a windowing
interface.  This windowing interface is fairly simple, and fortunately,
you don't have to display the actual windows.  There are 5 basic
operations:
</p><ol>
<li> Create a window
</li><li> Bring a window to the top
</li><li> Put a window to the bottom
</li><li> Destroy a window
</li><li> Output what percentage of a window is visible (i.e., isn't 
covered
     by windows above it).
</li></ol>

<p>
In the input, the operations appear in the following format:
</p><ul>
<li>Create window:               w(I,x,y,X,Y)
</li><li>Bring window to top:         t(I)
</li><li>Put window on bottom:        b(I)
</li><li>Destroy window:              d(I)
</li><li>Output percentage visible:   s(I)
</li></ul>
The I is a unique identifier for each window, which is one character.  
The
character can be any of 'a'..'z', 'A'..'Z', and '0'..'9'.  No extra 
spaces
will appear in the input.

<p> (x,y) and (X,Y) are opposite corners of the window.  When a window 
is
created, it is put `on top'.  You can't create a window with an 
identifier
that is already in use, but you can destroy a window and then create a 
new
one with the identifier of the destroyed window.  Coordinates will be
positive integers, and all windows will be of non-zero area (x != X and y
!= Y).  The x and y coordinates are between 1 and 32767 inclusive.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: window</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> The input file consists of a sequence of commands to your 
interpreter.
They will be listed one per line. Terminate the program when no more 
input
is available

</p><h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file window.in)</h3>

<pre>w(a,10,132,20,12)
w(b,8,76,124,15)
s(a)
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> Output lines only for the s() commands. Of course, there might
be several s() commands (but no more than 500) so the output should
be a sequence of percentages, one per line, stating the percentage
of the windows that are visible.  The percentages should be rounded
to 3 decimal places.

</p><h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file window.out)</h3>
<pre>49.167
</pre>
