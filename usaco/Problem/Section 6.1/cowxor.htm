<b><font size="6">Cow XOR</font></b><br>
Adrian Vladu -- 2005</center>

<p>Farmer John is stuck with another problem while feeding his cows.
All of his N (1 &#8804; N &#8804; 100,000) cows (numbered 1..N) are
lined up in front of the barn, sorted by their rank in their social
hierarchy.  Cow #1 has the highest rank; cow #N has the least rank.
Every cow had additionally been assigned a non-unique integer number
in the range 0..(2<sup>21</sup> - 1).

</p><p>Help FJ choose which cows will be fed first by selecting a
sequence of consecutive cows in the line such that the bitwise "xor"
between their assigned numbers has the maximum value.  If there are
several such sequences, choose the sequence for which its last cow
has the highest rank. If there still is a tie, choose the shortest
sequence.

</p><h3>TIME LIMIT: 0.5 sec</h3>

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: cowxor</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<ul><li> Line 1: A single integer N
</li><li> Lines 2..N+1: N integers ranging from 0 to 2<sup>21</sup> - 1, representing the cows' assigned 
numbers.  Line j describes cow of social hierarchy j-1.
</li></ul>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file cowxor.in)</h3>

<pre>5
1
0
5
4
2
</pre>

<h3>INPUT DETAILS:</h3>

There are 5 cows. Cow #1 had been assigned with 1; cow #2 with 0; cow #3 
with 5; cow #4 with 4; cow #5 with 2.

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<ul><li> Line 1: Three space-separated integers, respectively: the maximum requested value, 
the position where the sequence begins, the position where the sequence 
ends.
</li></ul>

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file cowxor.out) </h3>

<pre>6 4 5
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT DETAILS:</h3>

4 xor 2 = 6
(001) xor (010) = (011)
