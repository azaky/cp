<center>Silviu Ganceanu -- 2003</center>

<p></p><p>Farmer John is considering purchasing a new herd of cows. In
this new herd, each mother cow gives birth to two children. The
relationships among the cows can easily be represented by one or
more binary trees with a total of N (3 &lt;= N &lt; 200) nodes.  The 
trees
have these properties:

</p><ul>
<li>The degree of each node is 0 or 2. The degree is the count of
the node's immediate children.</li>

<li>The height of the tree is equal to K (1 &lt; K &lt;100). The height
is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to any
leaf; a leaf is a node with no children.</li> </ul>

<p>How many different possible pedigree structures are there?  A
pedigree is different if its tree structure differs from that of
another pedigree. Output the remainder when the total number of
different possible pedigrees is divided by 9901.
