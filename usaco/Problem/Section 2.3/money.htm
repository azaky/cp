<p> The cows have not only created their own government but they have
chosen to create their own money system.  In their own rebellious way,
they are curious about values of coinage.  Traditionally, coins come in
values like 1, 5, 10, 20 or 25, 50, and 100 units, sometimes with a 2
unit coin thrown in for good measure.

</p><p> The cows want to know how many different ways it is possible
to dispense a certain amount of money using various coin systems.
For instance, using a system of {1, 2, 5, 10, ...} it is possible
to create 18 units several different ways, including: 18x1, 9x2,
8x2+2x1, 3x5+2+1, and many others.

</p><p>Write a program to compute how many ways to construct a given
amount of money using supplied coinage. It is guaranteed that the
total will fit into both a signed long long (C/C++) and Int64 (Free
Pascal).

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: money</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The number of coins in the system is V (1 &lt;= V &lt;= 25).
</p><p>The amount money to construct is N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10,000).
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td>Two integers, V and N </td>
</tr><tr> <td> Lines 2..: </td> <td>V integers that represent the 
available coins (no particular number of integers per line)</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

</p><h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file money.in) </h3>

<pre>3 10
1 2 5
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing the total number of ways to construct N money
units using V coins.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file money.out)</h3>

<pre>10
</pre>
