<p>The structure of some biological objects is represented by the 
sequence
of their constituents denoted by uppercase letters. Biologists are
interested in decomposing a long sequence into shorter ones called
<i>primitives</i>.

</p><p>We say that a sequence S can be composed from a given set of 
primitives
P if there is a some sequence of (possibly repeated) primitives from
the set whose concatenation equals S.  Not necessarily all primitives
need be present.  For instance the sequence <tt>ABABACABAAB</tt>can be
composed from the set of primitives </p><pre>	   {A, AB, BA, CA, BBC}
</pre>

<p>The first K characters of S are the <i>prefix of </i>S with length
K.  Write a program which accepts as input a set of primitives and
a sequence of constituents and then computes the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from primitives.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: prefix</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

First, the input file contains the list (length 1..200) of primitives
(length 1..10) expressed as a series of space-separated strings of
upper-case characters on one or more lines.  The list of primitives is
terminated by a line that contains nothing more than a period (`.').
No primitive appears twice in the list.

Then, the input file contains a sequence S (length 1..200,000) expressed
as one or more lines, none of which exceed 76 letters in length.  The
"newlines" are not part of the string S.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file prefix.in) </h3>

<pre>A AB BA CA BBC
.
ABABACABAABC
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing an integer that is the length of the longest
prefix that can be composed from the set P.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file prefix.out)</h3>

<pre>11
