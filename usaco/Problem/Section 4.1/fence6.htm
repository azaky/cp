<p> The fences that surround Farmer Brown's collection of pastures have
gotten out of control.  They are made up of straight segments from 1
through 200 feet long that join together only at their endpoints though
sometimes more than two fences join together at a given endpoint.  The
result is a web of fences enclosing his pastures.  Farmer Brown wants to
start to straighten things out.  In particular, he wants to know which of
the pastures has the smallest perimeter.

</p><p> Farmer Brown has numbered his fence segments from 1 to N (N = the
total number of segments).  He knows the following about each fence
segment:
</p><ul>
        <li> the length of the segment 
        </li><li> the segments which connect to it at one end
        </li><li> the segments which connect to it at the other end.
</li></ul>
Happily, no fence connects to itself.

<p> Given a list of fence segments that represents a set of surrounded
pastures, write a program to compute the smallest perimeter of any pasture.
As an example, consider a pasture arrangement, with fences numbered 1 to
10 that looks like this one (the numbers are fence ID numbers):

</p><pre>           1
   +---------------+
   |\             /|
  2| \7          / |
   |  \         /  |
   +---+       /   |6
   | 8  \     /10  |
  3|     \9  /     |
   |      \ /      |
   +-------+-------+
       4       5
</pre>
<p>
The pasture with the smallest perimeter is the one that is enclosed
by fence segments 2, 7, and 8.
