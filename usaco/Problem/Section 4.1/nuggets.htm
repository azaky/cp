<p> Farmer Brown's cows are up in arms, having heard that McDonalds is
considering the introduction of a new product:  Beef McNuggets.  The
cows are trying to find any possible way to put such a product in a
negative light.

</p><p> One strategy the cows are pursuing is that of `inferior packaging'.
``Look,'' say the cows, ``if you have Beef McNuggets in boxes of 3, 6,
and 10, you can not satisfy a customer who wants 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 11,
14, or 17 McNuggets.  Bad packaging: bad product.''

</p><p> Help the cows. Given N (the number of packaging options, 1 &lt;= N
&lt;= 10), and a set of N positive integers (1 &lt;= i &lt;= 256) that
represent the number of nuggets in the various packages, output the
largest number of nuggets that can not be purchased by buying nuggets
in the given sizes.  Print 0 if all possible purchases can be made or
if there is no bound to the largest number.

</p><p> The largest impossible number (if it exists) will be no larger than
2,000,000,000.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file nuggets.in) </h3>

<pre>3
3
6
10
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

The output file should contain a single line containing a single integer
that represents the largest number of nuggets that can not be represented
or 0 if all possible purchases can be made or if there is no bound to
