<p> It's your first day in Quality Control at Merry Milk Makers,
and already there's been a catastrophe: a shipment of bad milk has
been sent out. Unfortunately, you didn't discover this until the
milk was already into your delivery system on its way to stores.
You know which grocer that milk was destined for, but there may be
multiple ways for the milk to get to that store.

</p><p> The delivery system is made up of a several warehouses, with
trucks running from warehouse to warehouse moving milk. While the
milk will be found quickly, it is important that it does not make
it to the grocer, so you must shut down enough trucks to ensure
that it is impossible for the milk to get to the grocer in question.
Every route costs a certain amount to shut down.  Find the minimum
amount that must be spent to ensure the milk does not reach its
destination, along with a set of trucks to shut down that achieves
this goal at that cost.

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> Two space separated integers, N and M.  N
	  (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 32) is the number of warehouses that Merry
	  Milk Makers has, and M (0 &lt;= M &lt;= 1000) is the number
	  of trucks routes run.  Warehouse 1 is actually the productional
	  facility, while warehouse N is the grocer to which which the
	  bad milk was destined.  </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 2..M+1: </td> <td> Truck routes:  three space-separated
	  integers, S<sub>i</sub>, E<sub>i</sub>, and C<sub>i</sub>.
	  S<sub>i</sub> and E<sub>i</sub> (1 &lt;=
	  S<sub>i</sub>,E<sub>i</sub> &lt;= N) correspond to the pickup
	  warehouse and dropoff warehouse for the truck route.
	  C<sub>i</sub> (0 &lt;= C<sub>i</sub> &lt;= 2,000,000) is the
	  cost of shutting down the truck route.  </td> </tr>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> The first line of the output should be two integers, C and T.
C is the minimum amount which must be spent in order to ensure the
our milk never reaches its destination. T is the minimum number of
truck routes that you plan to shut down in order to achive this
goal. The next T lines sould contain a sorted list of the indexes
of the truck routes that you suggest shutting down. If there are
multiple sets of truck routes that achieve the goal at minimum cost,
choose one that shuts down the minimum number of routes. If there
are still multiple sets, choose the one whose initial routes have
the smallest index.
