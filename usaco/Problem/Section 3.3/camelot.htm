<p>Centuries ago, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table
used to meet every year on New Year's Day to celebrate their
fellowship. In remembrance of these events, we consider a board
game for one player, on which one chesspiece king and several knight
pieces are placed on squares, no two knights on the same square.

</p><p>This example board is the standard 8x8 array of squares:<br>

<p>The King can move to any adjacent square from <img src="camelot_files/camelot-b.gif"> to <img src="camelot_files/camelot-w.gif"> as long as it does not fall off
the board:<br>

</p><center>

</center>

<p>A Knight can jump from <img src="camelot_files/camelot-b.gif">
to <img src="camelot_files/camelot-w.gif">, as long as it does not
fall off the board:

</p><center>
<img src="camelot_files/camelot-3.gif">
</center>

<p>During the play, the player can place more than one piece in the
same square. The board squares are assumed big enough so that a
piece is never an obstacle for any other piece to move freely.

</p><p> The player's goal is to move the pieces so as to gather them
all in the same square - in the minimal number of moves.  To achieve
this, he must move the pieces as prescribed above. Additionally,
whenever the king and one or more knights are placed in the same
square, the player may choose to move the king and one of the knights
together from that point on, as a single knight, up to the final gathering
point. Moving the knight together with the king counts as a single
move.

</p><p>Write a program to compute the minimum number of moves the player
must perform to produce the gathering.  The pieces can gather on any
square, of course.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: camelot</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> Two space-separated integers: R,C, the
number of rows and columns on the board.  There will be no more
than 26 columns and no more than 30 rows.</td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 2..end: </td> <td>
The input file contains a sequence of space-separated letter/digit pairs,
1 or more per line.  The first pair represents the board position of
the king; subsequent pairs represent positions of knights.  There might
be 0 knights or the knights might fill the board. Rows are numbered
starting at 1; columns are specified as upper case characters
starting with `A'.
</td> </tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file camelot.in) </h3>

<pre>8 8
D 4
A 3 A 8
H 1 H 8
</pre>

<p>The king is positioned at D4. There are four knights, positioned at A3,
A8, H1, and H8.

</p><h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with the number of moves to aggregate the pieces.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file camelot.out)</h3>

<pre>10
</pre>

<h3> SAMPLE OUTPUT ELABORATION </h3>
<p> They gather at B5.
<br> Knight 1: A3 - B5 (1 move)
<br> Knight 2: A8 - C7 - B5 (2 moves)
<br> Knight 3: H1 - G3 - F5 - D4 (picking up king) - B5 (4 moves)
<br> Knight 4: H8 - F7 - D6 - B5 (3 moves)
<br>1 + 2 + 4 + 3 = 10 moves.
