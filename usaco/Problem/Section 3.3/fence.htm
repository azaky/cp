<p> Farmer John owns a large number of fences that must be repaired
annually.  He traverses the fences by riding a horse along each and
every one of them (and nowhere else) and fixing the broken parts.

</p><p> Farmer John is as lazy as the next farmer and hates to ride the same
fence twice.  Your program must read in a description of a network of
fences and tell Farmer John a path to traverse each fence length exactly
once, if possible.  Farmer J can, if he wishes, start and finish at any
fence intersection.

</p><p> Every fence connects two fence intersections, which are numbered
inclusively from 1 through 500 (though some farms have far fewer than
500 intersections).  Any number of fences (&gt;=1) can meet at a fence
intersection.  It is always possible to ride from any fence to any other
fence (i.e., all fences are "connected").

</p><p>Your program must output the path of intersections that, if interpreted
as a base 500 number, would have the smallest magnitude.

</p><p> There will always be at least one solution for each set of input
data supplied to your program for testing.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: fence</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table border="1">
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> The number of fences, F (1 &lt;= F &lt;= 1024) </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> Line 2..F+1: </td> <td> A pair of integers (1 &lt;= i,j &lt;=
500) that tell which pair of intersections this fence connects.  </td>
</tr>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The output consists of F+1 lines, each containing a single integer.
Print the number of the starting intersection on the first line, the
next intersection's number on the next line, and so on, until the final
intersection on the last line.  There might be many possible answers to
any given input set, but only one is ordered correctly.
