<p> Farmer John has three milking buckets of capacity A, B, and C liters.
Each of the numbers A, B, and C is an integer from 1 through 20,
inclusive. Initially, buckets A and B are empty while bucket C is full
of milk. Sometimes, FJ pours milk from one bucket to another until the
second bucket is filled or the first bucket is empty. Once begun, a pour
must be completed, of course. Being thrifty, no milk may be tossed out.

</p><p> Write a program to help FJ determine what amounts of milk he
can leave in bucket C when he begins with three buckets as above,
pours milk among the buckets for a while, and then notes that bucket
A is empty.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: milk3</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>A single line with the three integers A, B, and C.
