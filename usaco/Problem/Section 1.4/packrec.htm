<br>The six basic layouts of four rectangles
</center>

<p> Four rectangles are given.  Find the smallest enclosing (new)
rectangle into which these four may be fitted without overlapping.  By
smallest rectangle, we mean the one with the smallest area.

</p><p> All four rectangles should have their sides parallel to the
corresponding sides of the enclosing rectangle.  Figure 1 shows six ways
to fit four rectangles together.  These six are the only possible basic
layouts, since any other layout can be obtained from a basic layout by
rotation or reflection.  Rectangles may be rotated 90 degrees during
packing.

</p><p> There may exist several different enclosing rectangles fulfilling
the requirements, all with the same area.  You must produce all such
enclosing rectangles.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: packrec</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>Four lines, each containing two positive space-separated integers that
represent the lengths of a rectangle's two sides.  Each side of a
rectangle is at least 1 and at most 50.

</p><h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file packrec.in) </h3>

<pre>1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

The output file contains one line more than the number of solutions.
The first line contains a single integer:  the minimum area of the
enclosing rectangles.  Each of the following lines contains one solution
described by two numbers p and q with p&lt;=q.  These lines must be
sorted in ascending order of p, and must all be different.
