<p> Farmer John takes the heritage of his cows very seriously. He
is not, however, a truly fine bookkeeper. He keeps his cow genealogies
as binary trees and, instead of writing them in graphic form, he
records them in the more linear `tree in-order' and `tree pre-order'
notations.

</p><p>Your job is to create the `tree post-order' notation of a cow's
heritage after being given the in-order and pre-order notations.
Each cow name is encoded as a unique letter. (You may already know
that you can frequently reconstruct a tree from any two of the
ordered traversals.) Obviously, the trees will have no more than
26 nodes.

</p><p> Here is a graphical representation of the tree used in the 
sample
input and output:
</p><pre>                  C
                /   \
               /     \
              B       G
             / \     /
            A   D   H
               / \
              E   F
</pre>

<p>The in-order traversal of this tree prints the left sub-tree, the
root, and the right sub-tree.

</p><p> The pre-order traversal of this tree prints the root, the left
sub-tree, and the right sub-tree.

</p><p> The post-order traversal of this tree print the left sub-tree,
the right sub-tree, and the root.
