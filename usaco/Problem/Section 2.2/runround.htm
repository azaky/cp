<p> Runaround numbers are integers with unique digits, none of which is
zero (e.g., 81362) that also have an interesting property, exemplified
by this demonstration:
</p><ul>
<li>If you start at the left digit (8 in our number) and count that
number of digits to the right (wrapping back to the first digit when no
digits on the right are available), you'll end up at a new digit (a
number which does not end up at a new digit is not a Runaround Number).
Consider:  8 1 3 6 2 which cycles through eight digits: 1 3 6 2 8 1 3
6 so the next digit is 6.</li>

<li>Repeat this cycle (this time for the six counts designed by the `6')
and you should end on a new digit:  2 8 1 3 6 2, namely 2.

</li><li>Repeat again (two digits this time): 8 1 

</li><li>Continue again (one digit this time): 3 

</li><li>One more time: 6 2 8 and you have ended up back where you 
started,
after touching each digit once.  If you don't end up back where you
started after touching each digit once, your number is not a Runaround
number.
</li></ul>

<p> Given a number M (that has anywhere from 1 through 9 digits), find
and print the next runaround number higher than M, which will always
fit into an unsigned long integer for the given test data.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: runround</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with a single integer, M

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file runround.in) </h3>

<pre>81361
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing the next runaround number higher than
the input value, M.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file runround.out)</h3>

<pre>81362
</pre>
