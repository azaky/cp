<h1>Broken Necklace</h1>
</center>

<p> You have a necklace of N red, white, or blue beads (3&lt;=N&lt;=350)
some of which are red, others blue, and others white, arranged at random.
Here are two examples for n=29:

</p><pre>                1 2                               1 2
            r b b r                           b r r b
          r         b                       b         b
         r           r                     b           r
        r             r                   w             r
       b               r                 w               w
      b                 b               r                 r
      b                 b               b                 b
      b                 b               r                 b
       r               r                 b               r
        b             r                   r             r
         b           r                     r           r
           r       r                         r       b
             r b r                             r r w
            Figure A                         Figure B
                        r red bead
                        b blue bead
                        w white bead
</pre>

<p> The beads considered first and second in the text that follows have
been marked in the picture.

</p><p> The configuration in Figure A may be represented as a string of b's
and r's, where b represents a blue bead and r represents a red one, as
follows:  brbrrrbbbrrrrrbrrbbrbbbbrrrrb .

</p><p> Suppose you are to break the necklace at some point, lay it out
straight, and then collect beads of the same color from one end
until you reach a bead of a different color, and do the same for
the other end (which might not be of the same color as the beads
collected before this).

</p><p> Determine the point where the necklace should be broken so that the
most number of beads can be collected.

</p><h3> Example </h3>

<p> For example, for the necklace in Figure A, 8 beads can be collected,
with the breaking point either between bead 9 and bead 10 or else between
bead 24 and bead 25.

</p><p> In some necklaces, white beads had been included as shown in Figure
B above.  When collecting beads, <b>a white bead that is encountered may
be treated as either red or blue and then painted with the desired color</b>.
The string that represents this configuration will include the three
symbols r, b and w.

</p><p>
Write a program to determine the largest number of beads that can be
collected from a supplied necklace.


</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: beads</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<table>
<tbody><tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> N, the number of beads</td>
</tr><tr> <td> Line 2: </td> <td> a string of N characters, each of which
is r, b, or w</td>
</tr></tbody></table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file beads.in) </h3>

<pre>29
wwwbbrwrbrbrrbrbrwrwwrbwrwrrb
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line containing the maximum of number of beads that can be
collected from the supplied necklace.

<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file beads.out)</h3>

<pre>11
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT EXPLANATION</h3>

Consider two copies of the beads (kind of like being able to runaround
the ends).  The string of 11 is marked.
