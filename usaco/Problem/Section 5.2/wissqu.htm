<p> It's spring in Wisconsin and time to move the yearling calves to the
yearling pasture and last year's yearlings to the greener pastures of 
the
north 40.

</p><p> Farmer John has five kinds of cows on his farm (abbreviations 
are shown
in parentheses): Guernseys (A), Jerseys (B), Herefords (C), Black Angus
(D), and Longhorns (E). These herds are arranged on the 16 acre pasture,
one acre for each small herd, on a 4 x 4 grid (labeled with rows and
columns) like this:

</p><pre>              1 2 3 4
             +-------
            1|A B A C
            2|D C D E
            3|B E B C
            4|C A D E
</pre>

<p> In the initial pasture layout, the herds total 3 A's, 3 B's, 4 C's, 3
D's, and 3 E's. This year's calves have one more D herd and one fewer C
herd, for a total of 3 A's, 3 B's, 3 C's, 4 D's, and 3 E's.

</p><p> FJ is extremely careful in his placement of herds onto his 
pasture
grid. This is because when herds of the same types of cows are too close
together, they misbehave: they gather near the fence and smoke 
cigarettes
and drink milk. Herds are too close together when they are on the same
square or in any of the eight adjacent squares.

</p><p> Farmer John must move his old herd out of the field and his new 
herd
into the field using his old brown Ford pickup truck, which holds one 
small
herd at a time. He picks up a new herd, drives to a square in the 
yearling
pasture, unloads the new herd, loads up the old herd, and drives the old
herd to the north 40 where he unloads it. He repeats this operation 16
times and then drives to Zack's for low-fat yogurt treats and familiar 
wall
decor.

</p><p> Help Farmer John. He must choose just exactly the correct order 
to
replace the herds so that he never puts a new herd in a square currently
occupied by the same type of herd or adjacent to a square occupied by 
the
same type of herd. Of course, once the old cows are gone and the new 
cows
are in place, he must be careful in the future to separate herds based 
on
the new arrangement.

</p><p> Very important hint: Farmer John knows from past experience that
 he
must move a herd of D cows first.

</p><p> Find a way for Farmer John to move the yearlings to their new 
pasture.
Print the 16 sequential herd-type/row/column movements that lead to a 
safe
moving experience for the cows.

</p><p> Calculate the total number of possible final arrangements for 
the 4x4
pasture and calculate the total number of ways those arrangements can be
created.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: wissqu</h3>

<h3>TIME LIMIT: 5 seconds</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> Four lines, each with four letters that denote herds.

</p><h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file wissqu.in)</h3>
<pre>ABAC
DCDE
BEBC
CADE
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p> 16 lines, each with a herd-type, row and column. If there are 
multiple
solutions (and there are), you should output the solution for which the
string of herd-types is first in lexicografic order.  If tied, you 
should
output the solution for which the string of the rows is first in
lexicographic order.  If still tied, you should output the solution for
which the string of the columns is first in lexicografic order.

</p><p> One more line with the total number of ways these arrangements 
can be
created.
