<p> Sorting is one of the most frequently performed computational tasks.
Consider the special sorting problem in which the records to be sorted
have at most<i> three</i> different key values. This happens for 
instance
when we sort medalists of a competition according to medal value, that
is, gold medalists come first, followed by silver, and bronze medalists
come last.

</p><p> In this task the possible key values are the integers 1, 2 and 
3.
The required sorting order is non-decreasing. However, sorting has to
be accomplished by a sequence of exchange operations. An exchange
operation, defined by two position numbers p and q, exchanges the 
elements
in positions p and q.

</p><p> You are given a sequence of key values. Write a program that 
computes
the minimal number of exchange operations that are necessary to make
the sequence sorted.
