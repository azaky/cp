<p>Three farmers rise at 5 am each morning and head for the barn
to milk three cows. The first farmer begins milking his cow at time
300 (measured in seconds after 5 am) and ends at time 1000. The
second farmer begins at time 700 and ends at time 1200. The third
farmer begins at time 1500 and ends at time 2100.  The longest
continuous time during which at least one farmer was milking a cow
was 900 seconds (from 300 to 1200). The longest time no milking was
done, between the beginning and the ending of all milking, was 300
seconds (1500 minus 1200).

</p><p>Your job is to write a program that will examine a list of
beginning and ending times for N (1 &lt;=  N &lt;= 5000) farmers
milking N cows and compute (in seconds):
</p><ul>
<li> The longest time interval at least one cow was milked. 
</li><li> The longest time interval (after milking starts) during which
no cows were being milked.
</li></ul>
