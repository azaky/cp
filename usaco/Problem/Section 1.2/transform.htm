<p> A square pattern of size N x N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) black and white
square tiles is transformed into another square pattern.  Write a program
that will recognize the minimum transformation that has been applied to
the original pattern given the following list of possible transformations:

</p><ul>
<li>#1: 90 Degree Rotation: The pattern was rotated clockwise 90 degrees. </li>
<li>#2: 180 Degree Rotation: The pattern was rotated clockwise 180 degrees. </li>
<li>#3: 270 Degree Rotation: The pattern was rotated clockwise 270 degrees.</li>
<li>#4: Reflection: The pattern was reflected horizontally (turned
into a mirror image of itself by reflecting around a vertical line in the
middle of the image).</li>
<li>#5: Combination: The pattern was reflected horizontally and then
subjected to one of the rotations (#1-#3). </li>
<li>#6: No Change: The original pattern was not changed. </li>
<li>#7: Invalid Transformation: The new pattern was not obtained by any of the 
above methods. </li>
</ul>

<p>In the case that more than one transform could have been used,
choose the one with the minimum number above.

<tr> <td> Line 2..N+1: </td> <td> N lines of N characters (each either
		`@' or `-'); this is the square before
		transformation</td> </tr>

`before' representation to the `after' representation.
