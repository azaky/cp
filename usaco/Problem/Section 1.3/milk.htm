<h1>Mixing Milk</h1>
</center>

<p>Since milk packaging is such a low margin business, it is important
to keep the price of the raw product (milk) as low as possible. Help
Merry Milk Makers get the milk they need in the cheapest possible manner.

</p><p>The Merry Milk Makers company has several farmers from which they
may buy milk, and each one has a (potentially) different price at which
they sell to the milk packing plant. Moreover, as a cow can only produce
so much milk a day, the farmers only have so much milk to sell per day.
Each day, Merry Milk Makers can purchase an integral amount of milk from
each farmer, less than or equal to the farmer's limit. 

</p><p>Given the Merry Milk Makers' daily requirement of milk, along with the cost
per gallon and amount of available milk for each farmer, calculate the
minimum amount of money that it takes to fulfill the Merry Milk Makers'
requirements. 

</p><p>Note: The total milk produced per day by the farmers will be sufficient
to meet the demands of the Merry Milk Makers.
