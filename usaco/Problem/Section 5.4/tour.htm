<p> You have won a contest sponsored by an airline. The prize is a 
ticket
to travel around Canada, beginning in the most western point served by 
this
airline, then traveling only from west to east until you reach the most
eastern point served, and then coming back only from east to west until
you reach the starting city.  No city may be visited more than once, 
except
for the starting city, which must be visited exactly twice (at the
beginning and the end of the trip).  You are not allowed to use any 
other
airline or any other means of transportation.

</p><p> Given a list of cities served by the airline and a list of 
direct
flights between pairs of cities, find an itinerary which visits as many
cities as possible and satisfies the above conditions beginning with the
first city and visiting the last city on the list and returning to the
first city.

</p><h3>PROGRAM NAME: tour</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td> Line 1:
    </td><td>
The number N of cities served by the airline and the number V of direct
flights that will be listed. N will be a positive integer not larger 
than
100. V is any positive integer. 
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Lines 2..N+1:</td><td>Each line contains a name of a city served
 by the
airline.  The names are ordered from west to east in the input file.  
There
are no two cities in the same meridian. The name of each city is a 
string
of, at most, 15 digits and/or characters of the Latin alphabet; there 
are
no spaces in the name of a city.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>Lines N+2..N+2+V-1:</td><td>
Each line contains two names of cities (taken from the supplied list),
separated by a single blank space.  This pair is connected by a direct,
two-way airline flight.
</td></tr>
