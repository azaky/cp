<p>Farmer John has a number of pastures on his farm. Cow paths
connect some pastures with certain other pastures, forming a field.
But, at the present time, you can find at least two pastures that
cannot be connected by any sequence of cow paths, thus partitioning
Farmer John's farm into multiple fields.

</p><p>Farmer John would like add a single a cow path between one pair
of pastures using the constraints below.

</p><p>A field's `diameter' is defined to be the largest distance of
all the shortest walks between any pair of pastures in the field.
Consider the field below with five pastures, located at the points
shown, and cow paths marked by lines:

</p><pre>                15,15   20,15
                  D       E
                  *-------*
                  |     _/|
                  |   _/  |
                  | _/    |
                  |/      |
         *--------*-------*
         A        B       C
         10,10   15,10   20,10
</pre>

<p>The `diameter' of this field is approximately 12.07106, since
the longest of the set of shortest paths between pairs of pastures
is the path from A to E (which includes the point set {A,B,E}). No
other pair of pastures in this field is farther apart when connected
by an optimal sequence of cow paths.

</p><p>Suppose another field on the same plane is connected by cow paths
as follows:

</p><pre>                         *F 30,15
                         / 
                       _/  
                     _/    
                    /      
                   *------ 
                   G      H
                   25,10   30,10
</pre>

<p>In the scenario of just two fields on his farm, Farmer John would
add a cow path between a point in each of these two fields (namely
point sets {A,B,C,D,E} and {F,G,H}) so that the joined set of
pastures {A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H} has the smallest possible diameter.

</p><p>Note that cow paths do not connect just because they cross each
other; they only connect at listed points.

</p><p>The input contains the pastures, their locations, and a symmetric
"adjacency" matrix that tells whether pastures are connected
by cow paths. Pastures are not considered to be connected to
themselves. Here's one annotated adjacency list for the pasture
{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H} as shown above:

</p><pre>                A B C D E F G H
              A 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
              B 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0
              C 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
              D 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0
              E 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
              F 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
              G 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1
              H 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
</pre>

<p>Other equivalent adjacency lists might permute the rows and
columns by using some order other than alphabetical to show the
point connections. The input data contains no names for the points.

</p><p>The input will contain at least two pastures that are not 
connected
by any sequence of cow paths.

</p><p>Find a way to connect exactly two pastures in the input with a
cow path so that the new combined field has the smallest possible
diameter of any possible pair of connected pastures. Output that
smallest possible diameter.
