<p> A pair of cows is loose somewhere in the forest.  Farmer John is
lending his expertise to their capture.  Your task is to model their
behavior.

</p><p> The chase takes place on a 10 by 10 planar grid.  Squares can be
empty or they can contain:
</p><ul>
<li> an obstacle,
</li><li>the cows (who always travel together), or
</li><li> Farmer John.
</li></ul>
<p>
The cows and Farmer John can occupy the same square (when they `meet')
but neither the cows nor Farmer John can share a square with an 
obstacle.

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>
Each square is<br>
represented<br>
as follows:
</p><ul>
     <li>.  Empty square
     </li><li>*  Obstacle
     </li><li>C  Cows
     </li><li>F  Farmer
</li></ul>
</td><td>
Here is a sample grid:
<pre>*...*.....
......*...
...*...*..
..........
...*.F....
*.....*...
...*......
..C......*
...*.*....
.*.*......
</pre>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p> The cows wander around the grid in a fixed way.  Each minute,
they either move forward or rotate.  Normally, they move one square
in the direction they are facing. If there is an obstacle in the
way or they would leave the board by walking `forward', then they
spend the entire minute rotating 90 degrees clockwise.

</p><p> Farmer John, wise in the ways of cows, moves in exactly the
same way.

</p><p> The farmer and the cows can be considered to move simultaneously
during each minute.  If the farmer and the cows pass each other
while moving, they are not considered to have met.  The chase ends
when Farmer John and the cows occupy the same square at the end of
a minute.

</p><p> Read a ten-line grid that represents the initial state of the 
cows,
Farmer John, and obstacles.  Each of the ten lines contains exactly ten
characters using the coding above.  There is guaranteed to be only one
farmer and one pair of cows.  The cows and Farmer John will not 
initially
be on the same square.

</p><p> Calculate the number of minutes until the cows and Farmer John 
meet.
Assume both the cows and farmer begin the simulation facing in the
`north' direction.  Print 0 if they will never meet.
