These are the final results of the USACO JANUARY 2011 programming
competition. The next official USACO contest is the FEBRUARY 2011
CONTEST currently slated for *three hours* and scheduled for 4-7
February, 2011. There's talk of an elite bonus contest at the end
of February!

Here's a history of the competition at the USACO contests:

Some 23 competitors were disqualified for cheating; at least 7 more
do not wish to share their real name. This is, I believe, the lowest
level of cheating ever.  Yay.

Java continues to hang by a thread in the Gold division. It's a
tough haul, though, with its interpreted runtime.

Mechanically and logistically, the contest ran mostly perfectly.

The Gold division had an anomaly: No pre-college contestant solved
all the test cases for the 'bottleneck' task; see the Gold text
below for more discussion.

The Bronze division had a flood-fill problem ('space') whose
potential test cases included data that required a tremendous
number of recursions using the standard recursive flood-fill
algorithm. See the Bronze text for more information.

The timings for JAVA are reported just as for C (et al.), though
JAVA runs slower, so all JAVA times are actually divided by 1.5 (or
sometimes an even larger number). If your JAVA program ran too slow
-- perhaps you're using RandomAccess input instead of BufferedReader
input. The latter can be orders of magnitude faster!

### GOLD Division ######################################################

IOI Gold medalist and MIT student Michael Cohen directoed the Gold
competition. Be sure to email me if you want to direct a contest!

The 'bottleneck' task presented an unexpected challenge to the Gold
competitors. Of the 17 test cases originally formulated and graded,
only 8 were solved by any of the pre-college competitors (Bruce
Merry, South African IOI ace, did submit a perfect solution -- but
he's an observer). This led to a serious debate about how to value
the task.  Here are some of the major underpinnings and debate
points of the competition:

    * We must come up with both task and test-case weightings
      in order to score the contest

    * Expectations are that 'more difficult' tasks should have
      higher task weights (likewise test cases)

    * No (scorable) problem properly solved 9 of 17 test cases for
      'bottleneck'

    * Many contestants seem to follow a strategy that requires
      them to solve a problem 'properly', to submit a solution that
      will work properly when a test case has the greatest possible
      dataset size. These contestants are reluctant to submit
      inferior solutions, e.g., a slower algorithm or search, that
      would solve only half the test cases.

    * Several of our contributors, in hindsight, believe that the
      contest perhaps should have allotted four hours instead of
      three hours for solving the tasks.

    * After removing all but one of the unsolved test cases, the
      statistics suggested that the 'bottleneck' task was the most
      challenging of the bunch (and thus, in the normal USACO scoring
      rubric, would be worth 400 points).
      
    * The solution technique required to get credit for all but one
      test case on 'bottleneck' was less sophisticated than the
      solution that earned full credit for the original 17 cases.

    * Coaches and other objected to awarding full credit and 400
      points to less sophisticated solutions.

    * The contest is a classic example of a level playing field:
      everyone plays by the same rules and has the same data and
      contest history fromw hich to draw conclusions.

    * USACO contests traditionally do not offer a priori task and
      case scoring levels. Why?  Because a problem budget of 72
      tasks per year does not allow us to run proper calibration
      pre-contests in order to determine the actual (vs. perceived)
      task difficulty.  Furthermore, a posteriori task and case
      score ratings can yield arguably 'fairer' levels, based as
      they are on actual contestant results.

In the most political sense, the final contest scoring devolved into
an almost political dilemma:

    * Weight 'bottleneck' high, since it was obviously the most
      difficult task, and that's fair.

    * Weight 'bottleneck' somewhat lower, since it's not fair that
      unsophisticated solutions should get so many points.

It's easy to see that both arguments have validity. The chosen
denouement feels like a compromise and tries to strike a balance
between both sides of the difficult argument.

As it turns out, the other two tasks were calculated to have
approximately equal difficulty. In the best spirit of emulating the
IOI, each of the tasks was thus equally weighted (though one has a
single extra point to make the total sum to 1000). We kept one of
the unsolved test cases. Its test-case weighting serves only to
compress the scores, so it's very low.

Test case weights were determined using the standard USACO probabilistic
method.

[The roadplane task has so many test cases because each of them
provides statistical 'information' and none is very correlated with
the others.]

Seniors continue last year's trend of dominating the entries. This
is surely indicative of a maturing populace of contestants:

The USA supplied 23.8% of the gold level participants (exactly the
same as last month); China supplied 13.7%.

This was a really challenging contest -- scores tended to run low.
The folks at the top were nicely spread out, though that necessarily
compresses the lower scores a little bit.

Of course, the curve is very much affected by the scoring algorithm
used. Likewise, the choice of test cases can push the scores all
around. We remove test cases that correlate highly with each other
in order to maximize the amount of information each case contributes.

The best way we know of to improve your score is still the USACO
training pages at http://train.usaco.org .

## SILVER Division #####################################################

USACO competitor Lewis Gan and veteran problem setter Sherry Wu set
the Silver contest. Thanks to them for creating a contest whose
results are just what we hope for!

The weights were determined mechanically using the USACO method:

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b
     --------------------------------------------------
    profits:  93 200.0  0 13  8  8  9  8 11 12 13 11
    divgold:  96 400.0  0  4  6  6  7 10 13 13 15 11 11
    traffic:  99 400.0  0  8  7  8  9  9 10  9 14 14 11

The 'profits' task ended up as the easiest of the group by far.

High school juniors now dominate the age distribution:

    2015   6 ( 2.0%) *
    2016   1 ( 0.3%)
    2017   3 ( 1.0%)

The USA supplied almost half (46.7%) of the silver participants.
No other country was above China's 6.0%.

This month's contest had a fabulous distribution given that many
folks are moving up from the Bronze division for the first or second
time. It's great to have several folks at the highest level with
many people populating each of the other levels.

China dominates this list with four top finishers.

Congratulations to these fine competitors.

20 competitors over 840 points has been promoted to the Gold division.

Bear in mind that programming contest scores are spread out across
hundreds of points instead of the usual 7 point spread for 93-100%
that so many student achieve in their academic pursuits.

## BRONZE Division #####################################################

Competitor Andre Kessler set the Bronze contest. Imagine how much
fun you could have directing a Bronze competition! If you'd like
to give it a try, let me know!

Four problems this time of somewhat varying difficulty. The
weightings were determined by the standard USACO method.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  g
     -------------------------------------------------------------------
        sym:  85 199.6  0  9  9  9 10  9  9 10 10 10
     dishes:  90 228.2  0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
      space:  93 297.5  0  6  6  6  6  7  8  7  5  6  6  6  6  6  6  6
    cropcir:  90 274.6  0 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10

None of those numerous test cases for 'space' has results correlated
with the other cases.

The contests posed an almost perfect span of difficulty from a
somewhat-challenging to more difficult.

The crop circle program, requiring two one-dimensional arrays and
a double-nested loop, was intended to be the easiest task; intentions,
of course, do not always work out.

Almost equal distribution across the three final years of high
school:

    Grde  #  Percent  
    2011  58 (25.4%) *******************

    2018   2 ( 0.9%)


The USA supplied 39% of the bronze participants; China supplied
9.6%; Kazakhstan supplied 9.2%.

The contest was not so hard as many:

## About the USACO Internet Programming Contests

These contests (the GOLD division in particular) are just incredibly
hard... really amazingly hard -- more so nowadays than even just a
year or two ago.

Winners must master not only algorithmic techniques like dynamic
programming but also the ability to write bug-free code quickly.
This requires practice and skill.  Don't despair if you didn't get
a perfect score this time -- it is hard!

Furthermore, the scoring mechanism is set up so that a huge percentage
of finishers scores in the 0..500 range -- different from many
contests where everyone finishes in the 800..1000 range and the
0..800 range is empty.  If we don't do this, we can't distinguish
among the top competitors.

## Want to Learn More?

Check out the USACO training pages at http://ace.delos.com/usacogate .
They provide practice challenges that can help you move up in the
rankings.

## How USACO Scoring Works

The score results are shown below.  I used a program to determine
how much each problem was worth and how much each test case was
worth.  Basically, it counts how many people got test cases and
problems wrong and uses that to estimate a difficulty and choose a
weight.

Each problem has a certain number of test cases along with a "weight"
that tells how many of the 1,000 points come from that program.
The test cases are also weighted; here is an example:

            points weight 1  2  3  4  5  6
            ------------------------------
      probname: 39 396.6  6  5  6  5  6 11

If you score full marks on cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, you'd have 6+5+6+5=22
out of 39 points for this problem and you receive:

                22/39 * 396.6 = 223.7

total points out of 396.6 possible.  The sum of each problem's
points is your total score.

## Closing (Thanks and Solicitation)

Thanks to the USACO coaches who helped bring this contest together.
Special thinks to our translators.

USACO accepts -- and uses -- problem submissions from anyone!  You
have a real leg up in the contest if we use your problem.  Feel
free to send programming tasks to me.  We now have a staff of 20
coaches and assistant coaches who vet the problems and create
prototype solutions.  This enables us to have many contests throughout
the year with at least some level of predictable quality.
