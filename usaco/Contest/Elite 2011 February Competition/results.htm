These are the final results of the USACO FEBRUARY 2011 programming
competition. The next official USACO contest is the MARCH 2011
CONTEST currently slated for *three hours* and scheduled for 11-14
March, 2011. There's talk of an elite bonus contest at the end
of February!

Here's a history of the competition at the USACO contests:

Some 28 competitors were disqualified for cheating of whom 8 simply
did not wish to share their real name. This is, for the second month
in a row, the lowest level of cheating ever.  Yay.

The grading system accepted 11.9 MB of text, a total of 7,218
submissions.

Here's a summary of how the final graded submissions looked (including
observers):

Java continues to hang by a thread in the Gold division. It's a
tough haul, though, with its interpreted runtime.

Mechanically and logistically, the contest had two main issues:
* the sunday morning disk maintenance overwhelmed the principle
   server for half an hour,
* test data for two tasks was augmented after the contest in order
  to shore up some weaknesses.

The timings for JAVA are reported just as for C (et al.), though
JAVA runs slower, so all JAVA times are actually divided by 1.5 (or
sometimes an even larger number). If your JAVA program ran too slow
-- perhaps you're using RandomAccess input instead of BufferedReader
input. The latter can be orders of magnitude faster!

Test data, analyses, and a display of everyone's submissions  are
available at http://ace.delos.com/FEB11.htm .

### GOLD Division ######################################################

USAICO coach and MIT student Jelle van den Hooff directed the Gold
competition along with Brian Dean and a host of assistants. Be sure
to email me if you want to direct a contest next year!

Test case weights were determined using the standard USACO probabilistic
method.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i  j  k
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    cowlpha:  96 266.4  0  9  9  9  9 10 12 11 12 15
   lostcows:  99 400.0  0  3  3  4  4  4  4 10  7  8  3  4  4  5  4  6  5 10  7  4
    protest:  98 333.6  0  7  7  8  7  8  8  9 15 14 15


[The lostcows task has so many test cases because each of them
provides statistical 'information' and none is very correlated with
the others.]

[The protest task gained a single test case to provide extra challenge
for some programs that made an unwarranted assumption.]

Coincidentially, the task difficulties had the ideal distribution,
with an easy, medium, and challenging task exactly evenly spaced!

Seniors continue last year's trend of dominating the entries. This
is surely indicative of a maturing populace of contestants:

  Distribution by grade:
    Grde  #  Percent
    2011  70 (39.3%) ******************************
    2012  68 (38.2%) *****************************
    2013  22 (12.4%) *********
    2014  12 ( 6.7%) *****
    2015   4 ( 2.2%) *
    2016   1 ( 0.6%)
    2017   1 ( 0.6%)

The USA supplied 20.8% of the gold level participants;
China supplied 14.6%.

This was a decently challenging contest. The superstars achieved
perfect scores, but below that folks were spread into a distribution
that sort of appears like a 'normal' curve if you squint real hard:

===== Distribution of scores =====
951..1000  9  *********                 &lt;--- all three
901.. 950  1  *
851.. 900  2  **
801.. 850  4  ****
751.. 800  8  ********
701.. 750  5  *****
651.. 700  0
601.. 650  7  *******
551.. 600 19  *******************       &lt;--- cowlpha + protest
501.. 550  9  *********
451.. 500 10  **********
401.. 450 14  **************
351.. 400 10  **********
301.. 350  7  *******
251.. 300 16  ****************
201.. 250 12  ************
151.. 200 14  **************
101.. 150  8  ********
 51.. 100  9  *********
  1..  50  4  ****
  0..   0 10  **********

Of course, the curve is very much affected by the scoring algorithm
used. Likewise, the choice of test cases can push the scores all
around. We remove test cases that correlate highly with each other
in order to maximize the amount of information each case contributes.

The best way we know of to improve your score is still the USACO
training pages at http://train.usaco.org .

Nine perfect scores plus five more at 850 or more:

     1  2012 BGR Rumen Hristov        1000  ** WINNER **
     1  2011 TUR Baris Kaya           1000  ** WINNER **

Interesting distribution of countries in this top 14 group:

   3 CHN     2 USA     1 VNM     1 LVA
   3 BGR     2 SGP     1 TUR     1 BLR

A great achievement for all concerned!  Congratulations to all these
fine programmers.

## SILVER Division #####################################################

USACO competitor Lewis Gan again directed the Silver contest,
creating two original tasks. He's been doing a great job this year!

The weights were determined mechanically using the USACO method:

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  g
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
       line:  91 306.7  0  6  6  7  8  8 13 13 15 15
      paren:  98 293.3  0  6  6  6 10 12 15 15 15 13
        tri:  98 400.0  0  2  2  3  2  4  5  4  5  9 13 14 15  2  3 15

Two evenly weighted slightly easier tasks and a challenge.

The 'tri' task had three test datasets added after preliminary results
were distributed.

High school juniors now dominate the age distribution:

The USA supplied 43.2%) of the silver participants. No other country
was above China's 8.8%.

This month's contest had a bottom-heavy distribution that included
no perfect score, probably due to folks are moving up from the
Bronze division for the first or second time. It's great to have
several folks at the highest level with many people populating each
of the other levels.

Congratulations to these fine competitors.

23 entrants (including observers) with at least 717 points have
been promoted to the Gold division.

Bear in mind that programming contest scores are spread out across
hundreds of points instead of the usual 7 point spread for 93-100%
that so many student achieve in their academic pursuits.

## BRONZE Division #####################################################

Competitor Andre Kessler set the Bronze contest for the second month
in a row. Imagine how much fun you could have directing a Bronze
competition! If you'd like to give it a try, let me know!

Three problems this time of somewhat varying difficulty. The weightings
were determined by the standard USACO method.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f  g
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     dance2:  92 200.0  0 10 10 10 10 10 10 11 12  9
     treats:  99 400.0  0 10  8  6 11 13 12 13 13 13
    hexagon:  96 400.0  0  4  5  7  5  4  7  7  5  8  7  5  5  9 10  8

The dance2 task was way easy compared to the other two. I had thought
the hexagon problem was daunting, but a bit of pencil-and-paper
analysis reduces it to 'challenging'. Don't be afraid to tackle
these; an hour or two of doodling can give great insight.

Plenty of juniors this time:

The USA supplied 35% of the bronze participants; China supplied
8.8%; Belarus supplied 8.4%.

As the season progresses, the bronze contests get more challenging,
as evidenced by the scores (remember: the hottest competitors move
up quickly out of the bronze division to the silver division -- 111
just from the previous contest alone!):

## About the USACO Internet Programming Contests

These contests (the GOLD division in particular) are just incredibly
hard... really amazingly hard -- more so nowadays than even just a
year or two ago.

Winners must master not only algorithmic techniques like dynamic
programming but also the ability to write bug-free code quickly.
This requires practice and skill.  Don't despair if you didn't get
a perfect score this time -- it is hard!

Furthermore, the scoring mechanism is set up so that a huge percentage
of finishers scores in the 0..500 range -- different from many
contests where everyone finishes in the 800..1000 range and the
0..800 range is empty.  If we don't do this, we can't distinguish
among the top competitors.

## Want to Learn More?

Check out the USACO training pages at http://ace.delos.com/usacogate .
They provide practice challenges that can help you move up in the
rankings.

## How USACO Scoring Works

The score results are shown below.  I used a program to determine
how much each problem was worth and how much each test case was
worth.  Basically, it counts how many people got test cases and
problems wrong and uses that to estimate a difficulty and choose a
weight.

Each problem has a certain number of test cases along with a "weight"
that tells how many of the 1,000 points come from that program.
The test cases are also weighted; here is an example:

            points weight 1  2  3  4  5  6
            ------------------------------
      probname: 39 396.6  6  5  6  5  6 11

If you score full marks on cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, you'd have 6+5+6+5=22
out of 39 points for this problem and you receive:

                22/39 * 396.6 = 223.7

total points out of 396.6 possible.  The sum of each problem's
points is your total score.

## Closing (Thanks and Solicitation)

Thanks to the USACO coaches who helped bring this contest together.
Special thinks to our translators.

USACO accepts -- and uses -- problem submissions from anyone!  You
have a real leg up in the contest if we use your problem.  Feel
free to send programming tasks to me.  We now have a staff of 20
coaches and assistant coaches who vet the problems and create
prototype solutions.  This enables us to have many contests throughout
the year with at least some level of predictable quality.
