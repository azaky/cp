Problem 2: Wifi Setup [Brian Dean, 2012]

Farmer John's N cows (1 <= N <= 2000) are all standing at various positions
along the straight path from the barn to the pasture, which we can think of
as a one-dimensional number line.  Since his cows like to stay in email
contact with each-other, FJ wants to install Wifi base stations at various
positions so that all of the cows have wireless coverage.

After shopping around, FJ learns that the cost of a Wifi base station
depends on distance it can transmit: a base station of power r costs A +
B*r, where A is a fixed cost for installing the base station and B is a
cost per unit of transmission distance.  If FJ installs such a device at
position x, then it can transmit data to any cow located in the range x-r
... x+r.  A base station with transmission power of r=0 is allowed, but
this only provides coverage to a cow located at the same position as the
transmitter.

Given the values of A and B, as well as the locations of FJ's cows, please
determine the least expensive way FJ can provide wireless coverage for all
his cows.

PROBLEM NAME: wifi

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Three space-separated integers: N A B (0 <= A, B <= 1000).

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains an integer in the range
        0..1,000,000 describing the location of one of FJ's cows.

SAMPLE INPUT (file wifi.in):

3 20 5
7
0
100

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 3 cows at positions 7, 0, and 100.  Installation of a base
station of power r costs 20 + 5*r.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The minimum cost of providing wireless coverage to all cows.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file wifi.out):

57.5

OUTPUT DETAILS:

The optimal solution is to build a base station at position 3.5 (with power
3.5) and another at position 100 (with power 0).  The first base station
covers cows 1 and 2, and the second covers cow 3.
