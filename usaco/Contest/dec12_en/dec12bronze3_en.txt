Problem 3: Crazy Fences [Brian Dean, 2012]

After visiting a modern art museum, Farmer John decides to re-design his
farm by moving all of the N (1 <= N <= 500) fences between his pastures! 
Each fence is describe by either a horizontal or a vertical line segment in
the 2D plane.  If two fences meet, they do so only at their endpoints.

FJ has C cows (1 <= C <= 500) on his farm.  Each cow resides at a point in
the 2D plane that is not on any fence, and no two cows reside at the same
point.  Two cows are said to be in the same community if one could walk to
the other without touching any fences.  Please help FJ determine the size
of the largest community.

PROBLEM NAME: crazy

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and C.

* Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains four integers: x1, y1, x2, y2. 
        These describe a fence running from point (x1,y1) to point
        (x2,y2).  Each fence is either vertical (x1=x2) or horizontal
        (y1=y2).  All coordinates are in the range 0 .. 1,000,000.

* Lines 2+N..1+N+C: Each line contains two integers x and y describing
        a cow at position (x,y).  All coordinates are in the range 0
        .. 1,000,000.

INPUT DETAILS:

There are 7 fences and 3 cows.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of cows in the largest community.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file crazy.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Cows #1 and #2 both belong to the same community, since they can visit
each-other without touching any fences.  Cow #3 cannot reach cow #1 or cow
#2 without crossing a fence.
